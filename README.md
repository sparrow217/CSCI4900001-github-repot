#This is our readme for our project.

Python requirements are kept in the requirements.txt file, and this file is generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

Python 3.5 is recommended for this project.  It can be downloaded and installed at [python.org](python.org).

###Development Environment
A Unix dev environment is recommended because the setup instructions provided are known to work in these environments using a bash terminal.  The instructions may work in a Windows bash terminal but have not been tested.  MySQL database will be used to store data within our development environment 


###Production Environment
A Linux production environment is recommmended, and Ubuntu version 12 and greater is prefered.  A database will be needed and configuration for the database will need to be provided.  MySQL is the preferred DBMS.


###Production setup
The app is not ready for production yet so this part is incomplete.

###Technologies used:
The development environment we will be using is a unix/linux environment. Also we will be using the MySQL relational database management system to store data that is extracted from GHTorrent. The application will be hosted on a server instance provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We will be using Python to handle the data on the backend and we will return a CSV file that will contain the data.
